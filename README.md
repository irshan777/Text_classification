# Text classification with tensorflow
A basic text classification pipeline using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes preprocessing steps like tokenization and padding, followed by splitting data into training and testing sets. A simple neural network model is built with an embedding layer, a dense hidden layer, and a sigmoid output layer for binary classification. The model is trained, evaluated for accuracy, and used to make predictions on unseen data. Ideal for beginners exploring natural language processing and sentiment analysis tasks.
